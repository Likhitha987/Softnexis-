# Task 3: Synthesizing the Design to Gates

##  Objective

The objective of this task is to synthesize a Verilog hardware design into a gate-level representation using the concept of a **standard cell library**. This step bridges the gap between high-level RTL design and actual hardware implementation.

---

## Design Description

In this task, a **1-bit Full Adder** is designed using synthesizable Verilog. The Full Adder performs the addition of two input bits along with a carry input and produces a sum and carry output.

### Inputs

* `A` – First input bit
* `B` – Second input bit
* `Cin` – Carry input

### Outputs

* `Sum` – Sum output
* `Cout` – Carry output

### Boolean Equations

* **Sum** = A ⊕ B ⊕ Cin
* **Cout** = (A · B) + (A · Cin) + (B · Cin)

## 🧪 Functional Verification

Before synthesis, the design is verified using a Verilog testbench.
All possible input combinations of `A`, `B`, and `Cin` are applied to ensure correct `Sum` and `Cout` outputs.

Simulation was performed using an **online Verilog simulator (EDA Playground)**.

## ⚙️ Synthesis Overview

Synthesis is the process of converting RTL Verilog code into a **gate-level netlist** using components from a **standard cell library**.

During synthesis:

* High-level logic (`assign` statements) is mapped to logic gates such as:

  * XOR
  * AND
  * OR
* The output is a **netlist** consisting only of standard cell instances and their interconnections.
* Timing analysis is performed based on the selected library and constraints.

## Key Learnings

* Difference between **RTL design** and **gate-level netlists**
* Understanding of **standard cell libraries**
* Importance of writing **synthesis-friendly Verilog**
* Verification before synthesis
* Role of synthesis in the VLSI design flow

---

## Outcome

* Successfully designed a synthesizable Full Adder
* Verified correct functionality using a testbench
* Understood how RTL logic maps to physical gates during synthesis
